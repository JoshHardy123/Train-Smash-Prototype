EXTRA INFORMATION

I APOLOGISE,THE FILE SIZE IS QUITE LARGE SINCE I GOT CARRIED AWAY WITH THE ASSETS

THE PATH AND ROAD CREATOR SCRIPTS ARE ALL DERIVED FROM SEBASTIAN LAGUE'S TUTORIAL ON PATH CREATION IN UNITY. ALTERATIONS WERE MADE TO SEVERL SCRIPTS TO SUIT THE PROTOTYPE.

I USED ALOT OF SMOOTH DAMPING INSTEAD OF PROPER ACCELERATIONS AS IT WAS QUICKER AND DIRTIER, PLUS I FEEL IT MAKES IT FAIRER TO THE PLAYER WHEN TRYING TO ACCELERATE FROM A NEGATIVE SPEED.

EDITOR STUFF

YOU CAN MESS AROUND WITH THE OBSTACLE SPAWNER INSIDE THE PATH CREATOR IN THE HIERARCHY. YOU CAN ADD NEW PREFABS TO THE LIST AND INC NUMBER OF OBJECTS TO SUIT OR USE ONE PREFAB AND USE INFINITE TO CREAT OBJECTS ALONG THE ENTIRE TRACK - LIKE THE TRACK PIECES ON THE PATH.

YOU CAN ALSO PLAY WITH THE PATH CREATOR IT IS PRETTY COOL. USING SHIFT+CLICK ON THE PATH TO CREATE MORE NODES OR SHIFT CLICK OFF THE PATH TO SPAWN A NEW ONE IN WORLD SPACE - THAT CAN BE A BIT MESSY AS IT SPAWNS FAR AWAY

YOU CAN ALSO CLICK THE TRAIN FRONT OBJECT TO MESS AROUND WITH SPEED AND GRAVITY ETC ON THE PLAYERS TRAIN

FINALLY, YOU CAN ALSO OPEN UP OBSTACLES IN THE PREFAB FOLDER TO ALTER SPEED REQUIRED AND SPEED REDUCTIONS UPON CONTACT
